# Flappy Bird Game

This is a 2D **Flappy Bird Game** created using **Python** and **Pygame**. The objective of the game is to navigate a bird between pipes by making it "flap" using the spacebar or the up arrow. The game ends when the bird hits the ground or a pipe.

- **Bird Control**: Press **Space** or **Up Arrow** to make the bird flap and rise.
- **Random Pipe Generation**: Pipes appear at random heights and move from right to left.
- **Collision Detection**: The bird collides with pipes or the ground to end the game.
- **Scoring**: The score increases as the bird successfully navigates through pipes.
- **Game Over Screen**: The game shows a "Game Over" screen when the player hits an obstacle.
